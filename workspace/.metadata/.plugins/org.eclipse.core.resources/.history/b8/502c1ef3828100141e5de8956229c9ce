/**
   Prints out a table of x and ln(x) so that the table is formatted using HTML.
   A web page is created by first printing:
   
      <html>
      <body>
      <table cellspacing=10>
      <tr><th>x</th><th>ln(x)</th></tr>
   
   Next, for each iteration of the loop, x and log(x) are calculated and
   the following line is printed:
   
      "<tr><td>" + x + "</td><td>" + Math.log(x) + "</td></tr>"
   
   The web page is finalized by printing:
   
      </table>
      </body>
      </html>
   
   TWhen run the program writes the output to a disk file named myLogs.html.
