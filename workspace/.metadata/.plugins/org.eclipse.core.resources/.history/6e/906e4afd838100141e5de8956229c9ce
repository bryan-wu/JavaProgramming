/**
 * Prints out a table of x and ln(x) so that the table is formatted using HTML.
 * A web page is created by first printing:
 * 
 * <html> <body>
 * <table cellspacing=10>
 * <tr>
 * <th>x</th>
 * <th>ln(x)</th>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * Next, for each iteration of the loop, x and log(x) are calculated and the
 * following line is printed:
 * 
 * "
 * <tr>
 * <td>" + x + "</td>
 * <td>" + Math.log(x) + "</td>
 * </tr>
 * "
 * 
 * The web page is finalized by printing:
 * 
 * </table>
 * </body> </html>
 * 
 * TWhen run the program writes the output to a disk file named myLogs.html.
